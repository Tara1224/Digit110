    <intro>Shrewsbury <dessert kind="cake"> Cakes</dessert>: Original Recipe. This recipe comes from
        MS Codex 625, a manuscript recipe book that belonged to a student in a <place>London</place>
        cooking school in the <time>early eighteenth century.</time> The pastry school was owned by
            <person>Edward Kidder</person>, who taught at a few locations in <place>London</place>
        between around <time>1720 and 1734</time>. Blank books with printed title pages seem to have
        been used by students to write down recipes they learned. Kidder also published his recipes
        in the printed volume, <title>Receipts for Pastry and Cookery, in 1720.</title></intro>
    
    <recipe>
        <step_original num="1">Take a pound of fresh butter a pound of double refind sugar sifted
            fine a little beaten mace &amp;</step_original>
        <step num="2">4 eggs beat them all together with your hands till tis very leight &amp; looks
            curdling</step>
        <step_original num="3">you put thereto a pound &amp; 1/2 of flower</step_original>
        <step_original num="4">roul them out into little cakes</step_original> Our recipe (halved
        from the original) <ing>1/2 lb. (2 sticks) butter, softened</ing>
        <ing>1/2 lb. sugar</ing>
        <ing>1/4 tsp. mace</ing>
        <ing>1/2 tsp. cinnamon</ing>
        <ing>2 eggs</ing>
        <ing>3/4 lb. flour</ing>
        <step num="1">Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar. </step>
        <step num="2">Then add the eggs and mix at medium speed until the mixture looks curdled. </step>
        <step num="3">Sift together dry ingredients and add at low speed until just combined. </step>
        <step num="4">Scoop and roll the dough by hand into 1-tbsp. balls, then pat flat.</step>
        <step num="5" kind="optional">[You could also refrigerate the dough until it’s firm enough
            to roll out on a flat surface and cut out into rounds.] </step>
        <step num="6">Bake at 350F for 15-18 minutes</step>
        <step num="7" kind="optional">(ours were about 1/3″ thick, so you could roll them thinner
            and have a slightly shorter cooking time).</step>They’re done once they turn the
        slightest bit brown around the edges. This halved recipe yielded about two dozen
        cookies.</recipe>

    <conclusion> The Results If you like snickerdoodles (and who doesn’t?), you’d like these. We
        added the cinnamon because we like it and couldn’t resist, and we thought it rounded out the
        mace nicely. These are mild, fairly soft cookies that are great with tea. We rolled and
        patted the dough into individual cookies because it was too soft and stick to roll out, but
        a little bit more flour and a stint in the fridge might make the dough easier to work with a
        rolling pin.</conclusion>
