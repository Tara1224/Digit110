            <h2>What Are Radio Plays?</h2>
            <p>
                Radio plays are scripted audio dramas created for broadcast, relying entirely on 
                <strong>spoken dialogue, sound effects, and music</strong> to tell a story. Unlike stage or film 
                productions, radio plays must create setting through <strong>voice acting and 
                    auditory cues alone</strong>, listeners imagine the scenes as they unfold. This makes 
                them especially interesting for corpus analysis because the frequency of <strong>names, sounds, narration, 
                    and repeated phrases</strong> often reflects the storytelling strategies used in audio-only media.

                For this corpus assignment, I examined the radio plays <strong>“Apple Tree”</strong> 
                and <strong>“Horror Movie Radio Spots.”</strong> In Voyant Tools, I found that the two
                corpora were extremely different. <em>Apple Tree</em>, which is a drama, repeated names 
                like Frank and Megan, showing how the story focuses on character interactions and 
                emotional narration. In contrast, the horror radio spots repeated sound cues and voice 
                directions, emphasizing atmosphere and timing rather than character descriptions.
                
                In AntConc, the 3-gram <em>“frank ashurst narrates”</em> appeared most often in 
                <em>Apple Tree</em>, reinforcing how much of the story is delivered through 
                first-person narration. Meanwhile, <em>“then in bg”</em> was the most frequent in 
                <em>Horror Movie Radio Spots</em>, showing how it relies on background effects and 
                sound-driven storytelling. These differences suggest that narrative dramas rely on 
                description while horror radioplays depend on 
                audio cues and structured timing. Together, the data shows how each genre uses 
                language to guide the listener's experience in completely different ways.

                For this corpus assignment, I examined the radio plays <strong>Robot Killer</strong> 
                and <strong>Anesthesia</strong>. In Voyant Tools, I found clear stylistic differences 
                between the two texts. <em>Robot Killer</em> repeated character names such as John and 
                Mary, which reflects its suspenseful structure driven by dialogue between 
                frightened characters. In contrast, the drama <em>Anesthesia</em> repeated words like 
                “Horace” and “John,” but these repetitions appeared in a more descriptive context.
             
                The AntConc results highlight this contrast. The 3-gram <em>“robot twenty three”</em> 
                appeared most often in <em>Robot Killer</em>, tying directly to the plot’s central threat. 
                Meanwhile, <em>“of the gas”</em> was the most frequent in <em>Anesthesia</em>, reflecting 
                the script’s focus on medical procedures. These results show 
                that horror relies on repeated plot-specific phrases to build tension, while dramatic 
                historical storytelling relies on repeated technical language to provide information. 
                This demonstrates how each play uses repetition to create different dramatic effects for 
                the listener.
