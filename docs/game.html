            <h2 class="section-title">Game Review: Inner Life</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Inner Life</strong> is an indie game that takes place inside a mechanical
                titan named Toni. The game begins in a desert, where you fail to save the previous
                titan but become determined to save the next one. When you enter Toni, you find
                yourself moving through robotic rooms filled with working machinery, which creates
                the feeling that you are exploring the inside of a living system. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="sectionBox">
            <h2 class="section-title">World & Setting</h2>
            <p> The graphics are not overly detailed, but they are effective at creating atmosphere
                and drawing the player into the world. Parkour is one of the main challenges in the
                game, and it reinforces the idea that you are navigating through a machine rather
                than a traditional environment. The challenge comes less from combat and more from
                timing jumps, navigating machinery, and figuring out what needs to be repaired
                next.</p>
            <p> Exploration is limited to specific rooms separated by doors and designed around
                individual challenges. The rooms include small details like pictures or interactive
                objects that add personality. When I became stuck during a parkour section, the game
                quickly returned me to the main area, which helped prevent frustration. Each room
                feels distinct because it presents a new problem that must be solved in order to
                move forward. </p>

        <section class="sectionBox">
            <h2 class="section-title">Characters & NPCs</h2>
            <p> The player controls a single character called <strong>The Healer</strong>, whose
                role is to help repair Toni from the inside. The Healer interacts with several NPCs,
                including workers and cultists, who share information through dialogue. Woody has a
                wooden leg and drinks often, Piper is hot-headed and strong, Connie is calm and
                brave, and the cult leader is angry and secretive. Toni himself is portrayed as
                hesitant and scared, which adds emotional weight to the player’s actions. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="sectionBox">
            <h2 class="section-title">Objects & Gameplay</h2>
            <p> Progress is made by helping Toni survive. The player investigates what has gone
                wrong and works to fix it by encouraging the humans inside Toni to return to their
                jobs. Objects such as tools and pieces of cultist stone are collected and used to
                restore broken systems. Some objects, like fish, can also be picked up, though their
                purpose is unclear, which adds a small sense of humor to the gameplay. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="sectionBox">
            <h2 class="section-title">Sound & Music</h2>
            <p> Sound and music shape the experience. The music is often startling, and sound
                effects become more intense during moments of danger. Loud sirens when Toni is close
                to dying create a strong sense of urgency and help guide the player’s emotional
                response. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="sectionBox">
            <h2 class="section-title">Meaning & Reflection</h2>
            <p> While <strong>Inner Life</strong> does not comment on itself in a meta way as a
                game, it does reflect real-world issues. The inclusion of an LGBTQ+ relationship
                between Piper and Connie adds meaningful representation and shows how games can
                reflect contemporary society. Overall, the game works as an artistic and immersive
                experience and is worth exploring for its unique setting and emotional approach to
                gameplay. </p>
