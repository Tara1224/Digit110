        <h2>links</h2>
        <p>Here is an example of a <a href="about.html">relative link</a> to a page inside the same
            folder.</p>
        <p>Here is some sample HTML to look at. This is a body paragraph with some
                <strong>inline</strong> code to feature some text. Here is <a
                href="https://behrend.psu.edu/penn-state-behrend">a link to an external
            website</a>.</p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq5WXmQQooo&amp;list=RDAq5WXmQQooo&amp;start_radio=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visit a funny song!</a>
      
        <p>One of the best resources for learning HTML is <a
                href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3Schools</a>. Here is a reference
            for <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/">color codes you can use for styling</a>.</p>
        <p>Each p element is a <strong>block</strong> element designed to make a block on the
            page.</p>
        <h2>My hobbies:</h2>
        <p>The next element after this is a ul, or <q>unordered list</q>. It makes a bulleted
            list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Videogames</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Drawing</li>
            <li>Napping</li>
            <li>Listening to music</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How about we look at an ol element, or <q>ordered</q> list? The code looks very similar
            to the <q>unordered</q> list. You have to see the difference by viewing in a web
            browser.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Wake up</li>
            <li>Go to class</li>
            <li>Go Home</li>
            <li>Take a nap</li>
            <li>Go to bed</li>
