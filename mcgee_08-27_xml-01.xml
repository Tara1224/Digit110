    <date>June 30th, 1917.</date>
    <letter_1>Even now that we are out of sight of land, it seems impossible that I am actually off
        to <current_location attribute="place">France</current_location> and, for the first time in
        my life, traveling alone. Everything has happened so quickly since the
            <military_relief_org>American Fund for French Wounded</military_relief_org> found an
        opening for me in <current_location attributes="place">Paris</current_location> that I
        suppose I am still somewhat dazed and bewildered. The fact that I don't know what it will
        all be like and that I can't look ahead makes it easier to be happy and live in the present.
        Of course I have had a bit of a taste in <city>New York</city> of the work that the A. F. F. W. is doing
        but its Headquarters in Paris will be different in some ways I fancy. </letter_1>
    <letter_2>I can't get over how lucky I am to have this chance for I realize how few girls of my
        age are getting across, and I understood the grit and pluck which made you encourage me on
        my great adventure and send me along a path which has proved so dangerous of late. </letter_2>
    <letter_3>As we drifted down the<current_location attribute="place"> river</current_location>,
        in the sunset glow with two absurd tugs puffing alongside, I know that many eyes were moist
        and that the same thought was in all our minds. How many of this ship's company will see
        that <time day="night"></time>sky-line again! It was very quiet, no one spoke much, and, little by little, the glow
        faded from the sky and one star after another appeared. I knew that you would be looking at
        those same stars down in <current_location attribute="place">Lakewood</current_location> and
        that your thoughts and prayers were the same that filled my heart at that moment. Somehow
        distance does not separate, after all.</letter_3>
    <letter_4>We waited near the <current_location attribute="place">Statue of
            Liberty</current_location> until midnight—a rumor had it that a "personage" was to come
        on board. This individual was shrouded in mystery until we put to sea when it was given out
        that the party which had clambered aboard in the night was none other than the Italian
        Mission. Our spirits rose at once for, what with <person name="1">Frank</person>
        <person name="2">Sayre</person> on the boat and these distinguished Italian gentlemen, we
        shall doubtless be honored by a bigger convoy and so doubly safe. However, thus far we have
        but two destroyers following us. They can be seen distinctly outlined against the horizon,
        one on each side, and seem to be the same somber gray which all ships are affecting in this
        war. A sailor informed me this morning that we weren't in much danger for the first four or
        five days but that after that I might see some excitement. Here's hoping!</letter_4>
    <letter_5>I have a small inside <current_location attribute="place">cabin </current_location>and
        my room-mate is quite a character. She is a native of <country>Haiti</country>, voluble and
        very portly—has four large pieces of baggage in our tiny stateroom, wears a costume which
        resembles a Mother Hubbard and smokes countless thin cigarettes that smell like incense!
        When I appeared, there didn't seem to be much room for me but, as she says, luckily I am
        small, and I was soon tucked into the upper berth with my belongings! She really isn't bad
        and after looking me over carefully told me that she didn't think we would fight and from
        that time has beamed upon me! She is going over to join her son who has been fighting with
        the French since the beginning of the war but will never go back to the Front now, having
        lost some fingers off each hand. She is so thankful, she says, that he hasn't lost more than
        his fingers. </letter_5>
